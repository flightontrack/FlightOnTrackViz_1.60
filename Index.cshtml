            <b>What is Flight On Track?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flight On Track</span> (FONT hereinafter) is a near-real-time cloud-based system which tracks aircraft position, velocity and altitude based on the information received from a pilot's smartphone.
            The detailed records are owned by a pilot, stored in the cloud and can be easily accessed via a browser, reviewed, downloaded to a file or shared with other users.
            It is a simple, free, automated logbook for both an aircraft and a pilot.
            More on FONT on @Html.ActionLink("[Help]", "Help", "Home") page.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Why a smartphone?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your phone is a sophisticated computer that is always with you. It has an ID uniquely identifying the pilot and a GPS that tracks his flights.
            The GPS has clear vision of all satellites in the sky, while the phone has unobscured access to ground mobile network.
            There is no need to invest tons of money. All you need is the FONT app installed on your smartphone to start using it right away.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Is there a need for this system and how it is different from others?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            A GA pilot keeps his flight history in a logbook. This process is still subjective, unreliable and if the logbook is lost, often there is no backup for it whether it paper or digital.
            Any GA airplane keeps its maintenance, registration and damage records but not its flight history.
            Unlike many other applications FONT maintains the detailed history of the pilot and the airplane flights in one place.
            The FONT client is a simple app designed the way to avoid any distruction when a pilot is in flight. <i>It is not a navigation system of any kind or pilot's help in flight.</i>

        <p>
            <b>Typical scenarios of usage:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed digital log of pilot flights easily shared either with friends or potential employer.</li>
            <li>Good presentation tool of an aircraft to the aircraft buyer.</li>
            <li>Good learning, distraction free tool for a student and instructor to record flights for a post flight review.</li>
            <li>A student pilot instructor or rental business can follow its flying airplane in real time.</li>
            <li>An examiner is making sure all required flights have accomplished before a check ride.</li>
            <li>Helpful tool to calculate hours and to complete the surveys conducted by FAA annually.</li>
            <li>To rent an aircraft it is a prove to ensure the pilot has met the current experience requirements laid out by the operator's insurance policy.</li>
            <li>Source of information for insurance companies, which often require minimum experience levels to get the right coverage.</li>
            <li>Make sure your altimeter reading matches to actual gps reading.</li>
            <li>Just share excitment of flight with friends and family.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>There are three components of the system:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app installed on a pilot's smartphone transmitting information to a remote server when the pilot is flying.</li>
            <li>The cloud storage which stores all the flight data.</li>
            <li>The browser application that provides access to the data.</li>
            <li>Optional: A small NFC tag received from us and clipped inside your aircraft that uniquely identifying the plane. The information from this tag can be scanned by the pilot's phone.</li>
        </ul>
